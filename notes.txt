    - collision control bug - done
            - possible issues => boolean hit is not registering
                              => x and y positions are not registering correctly
                              => issue was solved by checking where hit was registered and adding in discrepency
                              => started from moving parent divs

    - combine running animation into one animation using two keyframes - tbd - priority low
        - doable did this with the jump animation check there 
    - use e key to switch between platforms - tbd - priority low
        - with w and s
        - add in collision control after
    - add in duck animation for e key - tbd - priority low
        - new spritesheet
        - new keyframe animation
    - background drawn on canvas - tbd - priority low
        - method 1 - use canvas draw
        - method 2 - find a good background spritesheet that is wider than 925px (at least 1800px for parallax scroll)
    - allow for combination of jump and left/right movement - tbd - priority low
    
    - immediate
        - animating text (3) - extra
            - save phrase as a var in js

            - ties into new levels
            - classes and objects
            - best for multiple blocks and power ups for a new level
                - after timer is changed (300 seconds - 5 minutes) per level
                - powerups, more blocks per level, create objects for each powerup
                    - draw spritesheets
                        - draw basic images using ctx draw and repeat the function for each
                        object needed, include the drawing function as part of the object 
                        initialization
            - frees up memory for larger executables (key for containers/server connections)
        - create multiple blocks (2) - tbd - immediate
            - use appenchild 
            - lag when game first loads - check issue

        - enemy sprite lags when first loading - tbd
            - could be an issue with ram and tabs open
        - the scoreboard buttons dont loop through the alphabet properly = tbd
        - move other test files into repository
        - on a side note as the divs are changed the hit boxes need to be updated.
        currently there is an issue with the hitboxes, hitbox needs to be adjusted.
        - the hitbox for the box and jumping sprite are both set, hitbox for 
        the running sprite is same as the jumping sprite. best solution is
        switching to ctx draw
        - change src rename by adding a variable to a txt path - tbd - optional 
        - throw comments in code before functions, variable sections etc (section based)
