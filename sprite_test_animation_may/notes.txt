    - rotate through jump, attack and run animation - done
    - create discrepencies for spritesheet locations - done
            - when rotating through sprites megaman location appears to be 
                same location - done
            - change initial location - done
            - center animations - done

    - true parabolic jump - done

    - combine running animation into one animation using two keyframes - tbd - priority low
        - doable did this with the jump animation check there 
    - use e key to switch between platforms - tbd - priority low
        - with w and s
        - add in collision control after
    - add in duck animation for e key - tbd - need to make new spritesheet - priority low
        - new spritesheet
        - new keyframe animation
    - background drawn on canvas - tbd - priority low
        - method 1 - use canvas draw
        - method 2 - find a good background spritesheet that is wider than 925px (at least 1800px for parallax scroll)
    - allow for combination of jump and left/right movement - tbd - priority low
    - clean up code - tbd - priority low 
        - final commit
        - once a week
        - group into functions
        - remove log statements
        - look for further efficiencies
    - collision control - tbd - low priority
            - borders - done
            - with other objects - done
                - power up - tbd
                    - 1-up, restart, invincible (star), fireball - tbd
                - enemy (bot) - done
            - on a side note as the divs are changed the hit boxes need to be updated.
            currently there is an issue with the hitboxes, hitbox needs to be adjusted.
                - the hitbox for the box and jumping sprite are both set, hitbox for 
                the running sprite is same as the jumping sprite. best solution is
                switching to ctx draw
    - collision control bug - done
            - possible issues => boolean hit is not registering
                              => x and y positions are not registering correctly
                              => issue was solved by checking where hit was registered and adding in discrepency
                              => started from moving parent divs

        - oops (5) - tbd
            - ties into new levels
            - classes and objects
            - best for multiple blocks and power ups for a new level
                - after timer is changed (300 seconds - 5 minutes) per level
                - powerups, more blocks per level, create objects for each powerup
                    - draw spritesheets
                        - draw basic images using ctx draw and repeat the function for each
                        object needed, include the drawing function as part of the object 
                        initialization
            - frees up memory for larger executables (key for containers/server connections)
